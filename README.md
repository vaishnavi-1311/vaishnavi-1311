Hello, world! I'm Vaishnavi pursuing Bioinformatics undergrad. I'm curious in learning coding and I'm currently doing some cool projects here. 
So, as of now, I created a platelet donor management system using HTML, PHP MySQL, JS and CSS.
And second one is the really cool thing that I came across. So I tried making maze games using pathfinding algorithms- Depth-first search, Breadth-first search and A* algorithm.
Looking forward to learning cool stuffs everyday here!!
